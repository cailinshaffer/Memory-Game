# Memory-Game

## How is your memory??

Trying to put your skills to the test? Let's test your memory!

Each player will tap two tiles to try and get matching images. Don't get it right the first try? Remember where tials are and try again on the next turn!

Check out my Example!

## MVP
- Create a game using Java Script, HTML, and CSS.
- Render the screen with a button for instructions and a 2 player option.
- Render tiles on the screen with the ability to flip over and show the image on the other side.
- Have screen alternate between players.
- Render tiles unaccesible once match is made.
- Keep track of score.
- Display winner.
- Style up CSS.

## Stretch goals
 - Make an easy and a hard mode with more tiles.
 - Show animation whenever a game is won.
 - Make a computer player.
 
 
## Post-Project Reflection
# Growth:
- Cleaner code in HTML and JS.
- Review CSS, figure out which CSS targets parents and children elements in HTML.

# Problems I Encountered
-Alternating betweeen player one and two.
-Reseting gameboard, timer and score with out a page reload function.
-Calculating score with time passed.
